MultiSegmentCountdownTimer
==========================

A Javascript countdown timer, designed for the browser, that provides
support for a scenario where your countdown can lead to another
countdown, with that count down displaying a different message.

An example scenario is that your event starts on 14 July 2020, but
you have discount tickets until the 10 April 2020. You could display
a static value and only refresh when the page reloads, or you can
use MultiSegmentCountdownTimer to automatially update the display
without reloading the page.

The project is currently an alpha, but as can be seen in the example
works well enough for the prototype scenario.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
